# node-tensorflow

A node.js module for using TensorFlow.

TensorFlow is Google's machine learning library. See https://tensorflow.org
for more details.

This project is just getting started, so there isn't much yet, but the goal
is to bring together the power of TensorFlow and the elegance of JavaScript!
It will be available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/tensorflow as it is
developed.

Stay tuned for more. If you're interested in helping out, by all means,
